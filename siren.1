.Sh NAME
.Nm siren
.Nd text-based audio player
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm siren
.Op Fl lv
.Op Fl c Ar directory
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a text-based audio player.
.Pp
The options are as follows.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c Ar directory
Use
.Ar directory
as the configuration directory.
The default is
.Pa ~/.siren .
.It Fl l
Log error and informational messages to a file.
The file is created in the current directory and named
.Pa siren-%d.log
where
.Pa %d
is replaced with
.Nm Ap s
process ID.
.It Fl v
Print version information and exit.
.El
.Sh USER INTERFACE
.Nm Ap s
user interface consists of three areas.
.Pp
The bottom line is the status line.
It is used to display error and informational messages and to enter commands
and search queries.
.Pp
The two lines above the status line show playback-related information, such as
the currently playing track and the volume level.
.Pp
The remainder of the screen is used to display a view.
A view displays a specific type of information.
Only one view can be displayed at a time, but each view can be selected by
using the
.Ic select-view
command or the default key bindings.
.Pp
The available views are as follows.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Sy Library view
The library view shows all tracks in the library.
The
.Ic add-path
command
.Po
see
.Sx COMMANDS
below
.Pc
may be used to add tracks.
The library view can be displayed by pressing the
.Ic 1
key.
.It Sy Playlist view
The playlist view shows the playlist loaded with the
.Ic load-playlist
command.
It can be displayed by pressing the
.Ic 2
key.
.It Sy Browser view
The browser view shows the contents of a directory.
By default only directories and supported audio files are shown.
The browser view can be used to browse through the file system and play back
audio files or add them to the library or queue.
The browser view can be displayed by pressing the
.Ic 3
key.
.It Sy Queue view
The queue view shows all tracks that have been added to the queue.
Tracks in the queue will be played back before those in other views.
A track will be removed from the queue as soon as it is being played back.
The queue view can be displayed by pressing the
.Ic 4
key.
.El
.Pp
The playback source is the view that provides the tracks for playback.
The library, playlist and browser views each can act as a playback source.
A view implicitly becomes the playback source whenever a track from that view
is selected for playback.
.Sh KEY BINDINGS
.Nm
supports configurable key bindings.
Each key binding has a scope: it is either specific to one view or common to
all views.
Key bindings are changed with the
.Ic bind-key

command.

.Sh COMMANDS
.Nm

Commands can be entered at the command prompt, bound to a key or added to the
configuration file.
.Pp
Commands are parsed in a way similar to most shells.
A command line is delimited by a newline character or a
.Sq #
character.
A
.Sq #
character introduces a comment and extends to the end of the line.
.Pp
A command line is broken into separate words.
A word is a sequence of characters and is delimited by one or more space or tab
characters.
On each word, tilde expansion and
.Xr glob 3
pattern expansion is performed.
.Pp
The
.Sq # ,
.Sq ~ ,
.Sq * ,
.Sq \&? ,
.Sq \&[ ,
.Sq \e ,
.Sq \(aq
and
.Sq \&"
characters and the space and tab characters are special characters.
A special character can be escaped by prepending it with a
.Sq \e
character or by enclosing it by matching
.Sq \(aq
or
.Sq \&"
characters.

.Pp
There are six types of options.
They are as follows.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Sy Attribute options
Attribute options control the character attributes of a user-interface element.
Valid values are
.Em blink ,
.Em bold ,
.Em dim ,
.Em normal ,
.Em reverse ,
.Em standout
and
.Em underline .
Two or more attributes can be specified by separating them by a comma.
.It Sy Colour options
Colour options control the foreground and background colour of a user-interface
element.
Valid values are
.Em black ,
.Em blue ,
.Em cyan ,
.Em default ,
.Em green ,
.Em magenta ,
.Em red ,
.Em white
and
.Em yellow .
.Pp
If supported by the terminal, the colour
.Em default
corresponds to the terminal's original background or foreground colour.
Otherwise,
.Em default
is equivalent to
.Em black
when used as a background colour and to
.Em white
when used as a foreground colour.
.It Sy Boolean options
Valid values of Boolean options are
.Em true
and
.Em false .
As a convenience, the values
.Em on ,
.Em off ,
.Em yes ,
.Em no ,
.Em 1
and
.Em 0
are accepted as well.
.It Sy Number options
Valid values of number options are non-negative integers.
The maximum value is option-specific.
.It Sy String options
Valid values of string options are option-specific.
.It Sy Format options
Format options are strings that control the formatting of information displayed
on the screen.
The syntax is reminiscent of that of the
.Xr printf 3
family of functions.
.Pp
A format string consists of ordinary characters, which are displayed unchanged,
and format fields, which specify how a variable is to be displayed.
A format field is introduced by the
.Sq %
character.
Then, the following appears in sequence.
.Bl -dash
.It
An optional
.Sq -
character to specify that the variable is to be left-aligned within the field.
The default is to right-align.
.It
An optional
.Sq 0
character to specify that the variable is to be padded with leading zeroes.
The default is to pad with space characters.
This flag is ignored if the variable is to be left-aligned.
.It
An optional sequence of numeric characters to specify the field width.
If the
.Sq *
character is specified, the width is variable and will be so long as possible.
If there are two or more fields with a variable width, the available space will
be divided equally between them.
.It
The name of the variable to display, enclosed by braces
.Po
i.e. the
.Sq {
and
.Sq }
characters
.Pc .
Some variables also have a one-character alias.
If this alias is specified, the braces may be omitted.
Which variables are available is dependent on the option.
.Pp
Conditional fields are also supported.
A conditional field is enclosed in braces and begins with a
.Sq \&?
character, followed by the name of the variable and two comma-separated fields.
If the variable is a non-zero number or a non-empty string, the first value is
displayed; otherwise, the second value.
For example,
.Sq %{?artist,yes,no}
yields
.Sq yes
if
.Em artist
is a non-empty string and
.Sq no
otherwise.
.El
.Pp
A literal
.Sq %
character is displayed by specifying
.Sq %%
in the format string.
