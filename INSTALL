Running Siren without installing it first
-----------------------------------------

It is possible to run Siren without installing it first. This is useful, for
example, if you wish to try out Siren. To do so, run the following commands.

	./configure plugindir="$PWD"
	make
	./siren

Should you later wish to install Siren, then ensure you reconfigure and rebuild
it first so that the plugindir variable is set to a proper value. It is perhaps
safest to start from a clean source directory. Therefore, run the following
command before reconfiguring.

	make cleandir

Uninstalling Siren
------------------

Siren can be uninstalled with the following command.

	make uninstall
